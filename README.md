Programming exercises of VTU 7th Sem for Machine Learning Lab

Here all the programs for 7th semeseter Machine Learning Laboratory exercises are provided.
The program details are as follows. All the programs are written to use python 2.7

*MLLab01-find-S.py:*
Implementation of find-S algorithm to find most specific solution that matches the data.
The program requires that valid values are defined in the variable $validdata$
